# Zeronia.org

There will be 4 main web pages, which will be static, but updateable. There will also be an admin portal with a password and some other form of authentication to make changes and updates to the website.

- # Announcements
  * Will be able to add new announcements about released games, projects, etc. through the admin portal.
  * The date will show up through vanilla JavaScript.
  * The webpage will show the most recent two or three announcements. To load all of the rest of them, a load button will be generated at the bottom.

- # Map Gallery
  * Users will be able to navigate to individual pages for all of the currently released minigame projects.
  - The idea is to have blocks dedicated to each map that flip over when clicked (through an animation library), which will have a short description and a link to the project's page. These might just be dynamically generated based on input information received through the admin portal to make it easy to update descriptions for new versions of the game, add more .zip files for map downloads, etc.
  - Individual minigame project pages will have:
    - An embedded YouTube trailer
    - An image gallery with captions
    - A description
    - A player count
    - A map version selection: Map download button, resource pack download button, and a list of compatible Minecraft: Java Edition versions.
    - An indication of where the map can be played live, such as https://cubekrowd.net/, https://trial.stickypiston.co/map, and Minecraft Realms
    - Credits to the people who helped with the map
